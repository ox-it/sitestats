1. About
============================================
Site Stats is a tool for Sakai for showing site usage statistics.

Tool information is organized in 2 screens:
	- Overview: contains summary information about site visits and activity;
	- Reports:  generated exportable reports about site visits, tool and resource activity.
		
Tool support can be added/removed sakai-wide (by using configuration files) or on site basis (by
using the tool Preferences screen). See SiteStats Confluence page for configuration instructions.

Feel free to send suggestions to ufpuv-suporte@ufp.pt or by using the SiteStats JIRA section.


2. Updating from previous releases
============================================
  1. Undeploy previous SiteStats deployments (folder structure and jar/war filenames were changed)
